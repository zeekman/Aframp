Aframp — Brand Identity & UI/UX Case Study

Overview

Aframp is a fintech product designed to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance in Africa.
This project focuses on building a modern, secure, and African-centric brand identity for a crypto–fiat on-ramp and off-ramp platform.

The goal was to communicate trust, flow of value, and accessibility through clear branding and interface design.

Minimal, confident visuals

Aframp’s identity reflects African innovation without stereotypes, positioning it as a global fintech product.
