Aframp — Dashboard & Landing Page Redesign
Overview

Aframp is a multi-chain fintech wallet bridging traditional finance and decentralized finance in Africa.
I worked on the redesign of the dashboard and landing page, focusing on clarity, trust, and a modern fintech experience.

Role

UI/UX Designer

Dashboard redesign

Landing page redesign

Layout & visual hierarchy

UI styling and interaction clarity

Problem

The existing experience presented dense financial data with limited hierarchy and lacked a strong first-impression narrative on the landing page. This reduced clarity, confidence, and ease of use for users managing real financial assets.

Goals

Improve dashboard readability and data hierarchy

Make key actions (swap, view assets) faster and clearer

Redesign the landing page to communicate trust and value instantly

Maintain a modern, premium fintech aesthetic

Dashboard Redesign

I redesigned the dashboard to prioritize:

Total balance and performance at a glance

Clear asset breakdown with market feedback

Modular sections for balance, swaps, and activity

High-contrast visuals to improve focus and trust

The result is a cleaner, more confident financial overview that reduces cognitive load.

Landing Page Redesign

I redesigned the landing page to:

Clearly communicate Aframp’s value proposition

Emphasize security, flow of value, and African identity

Use bold typography and contrast for strong first impressions

Guide users toward primary actions without friction

The landing page now acts as a clear entry point into the product, aligning brand and usability.

Outcome

Improved clarity and usability across the product

Stronger visual trust for financial interactions

Consistent design language between landing page and dashboard

Scalable foundation for future features
